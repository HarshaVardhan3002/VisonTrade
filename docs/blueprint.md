## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) for highlights and interactive elements; provides a futuristic touch while maintaining visibility against a dark background.
- Background color: Dark navy (#1A202C), almost black, provides a strong contrast and emphasizes the neon elements while creating a dark-mode first design.
- Accent color: Neon Green (#39FF14) used sparingly for calls to action, status indicators, and interactive elements to draw attention and complement the electric blue.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for UI elements.
- Full-screen container with modular sections, sticky top navigation, and floating UI elements to mimic VisionOS aesthetic.
- Use subtle, smooth transitions and glowing hover states on interactive elements to create depth and futuristic feel.
- Minimalist glyph-style icons for navigation and key functions, colored with neon accents.
