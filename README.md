## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/visiontrade.git
    cd visiontrade
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

    ```.env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
    ```
    *Note: Genkit uses this variable. Some Genkit examples might refer to `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`. `GOOGLE_API_KEY` takes precedence.*


4.  **Run the development server:**

    The application requires two separate processes to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI server.

    - **Terminal 1: Run the Next.js App**
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
      This will start the web application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

    - **Terminal 2: Run the Genkit AI Server**
      ```sh
      npm run genkit:watch
      ```
      This starts the Genkit server in watch mode, which provides the AI functionalities.

5.  **Open the application:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:9002` in your browser to see the application in action.
